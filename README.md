# SortingAlgorithms
This C program showcases the implementation of six fundamental sorting algorithms, offering a comprehensive exploration of sorting techniques. The included algorithms are:

Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
The program initializes an array with random values, providing a dynamic dataset for testing each sorting algorithm's efficiency and correctness. Users can interactively select a sorting algorithm of their choice, and the program displays the sorted array.

This educational tool serves as a practical resource for learning and comparing different sorting methodologies, aiding programmers and computer science enthusiasts in understanding algorithmic principles and their real-world applications.
